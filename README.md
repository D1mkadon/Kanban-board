Need to insert link from any public github repository
like 'https://github.com/D1mkadon/Kanban-board'
with issues !important

First step it`s fetching issues and inserting them in todo column

Second step make any changes with todo`s

Third step insert second link and make some changes

Fourth step insert first link and you can see all changes before (fetch is not going again)
When the user loads issues for Repo1 -> Repo2 -> Repo1 he should see all changes he did for Repo1.
